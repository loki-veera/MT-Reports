    \chapter{Introduction}

The development of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) made tasks such as object classification and object detection simple.
These DNNs has seen their way to various real world scenarios such as autonomous driving \cite{autonomousdriving}, semi-autonomous robotic surgery \cite{roboticsurgery} and also in space rovers \cite{Marsrover_1}, \cite{Marsrover_2}.
DNNs are majorly deployed in the perception stack in the autonomous pipeline. 
Figure \ref{fig:Apollopipeline} depicts the pipeline of the modules present in one of the open source autonomous driving platform called Apollo \cite{baiduapollo}.
From this pipeline, we can infer that the most of the decisions regarding the vehicle control made by autonomous system is dependent on the output of the perception module.
Since the perception module plays such significance, the developers of the perception stack must make sure that the output is flawless.

\end{figure}

The DNNs deployed in perception module are needed to be trained on the dataset which should be similar to area of its deployment.
For example, an autonomous driving agent must be trained on dataset containing roads, vehicles, vegetation and other objects found around road.
This closedness of the dataset i.e., fixed number of classes, will cause an issue when the DNN encounter an unknown object in real world.
This unknown object is predicted as one of the class in the dataset, leading to radical decisions when this error is propogated down the pipeline in Figure \ref{fig:Apollopipeline}.
One such real world problem is encountered by the Tesla autonomous driving platform.

Figures \ref{fig:teslafails_1} and \ref{fig:teslafails_2} depict the misdetections from the Tesla autonomous driving system.
The problem with first one, is the moon is detected as the yellow signal light and second one has the problem of misdetection of burger king sign as stop signal.
These misdetections of unknown objects might lead to consequences beyond imagination.
This questions the safety of the Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) predictions.
An effort has been made in this thesis to detect these unknown objects in 3D LiDAR data using uncertainty score.
The unknown obejcts in the real world which are not present in the training dataset are called as out-of-distribution (OOD) class. 
More discussion on the OOD is presented in Section \ref{sec:oodvanom}.
More discussion on misdetections in a DNN trianed on MNIST and tested on USPS is presented in Section \ref{sec:mnistvusps}

Let us time travel back to $18^{th}$ century and assume that we had implemented a model to detect ships, the dataset images for the trained model will be similar to Figure \ref{fig:old_ship}.
$18^{th}$ century ships as in \ref{fig:old_ship} can be defined as ``\textit{ship contains hull and sails}''.
Fast forward to present time, current ships are as shown in Figure \ref{fig:trian_cruiser}.
Ship as in \ref{fig:trian_cruiser} can be defined as ``\textit{ship contains hull and passenger decks stacked upon each other}''.
Now if we want to deploy the old model trained with old ships to detect the present generation of ships, it is diffcult because of the change in definition and properties of ship. 
This change in data distribution over a period of time is called ``\textit{distributional shift}'' of the data.

Anomaly can be defined as the patterns that doesn't conform to the expected training behavior.
By this definition, Figure \ref{fig:anom_container} and Figure \ref{fig:anom_titanic} can be considerd as anomalies.
This is becuase Figure \ref{fig:anom_container} is a container ship looking similar to Figure \ref{fig:trian_cruiser} instead of passenger decks we have containers stacked.
Figure \ref{fig:anom_titanic} is also anomaly because the Titanic also has a hull, passenger decks and chimneys. 
This additional chimnies as a fetures deviates this image from the definition of the ship and can be considered as ``\textit{anomaly}''.

The input for out of distribution (OOD) is drawn from an unknown distribution of unknown data, which is not near to the trianing distribution.
Figures \ref{fig:ood_submarine} and \ref{fig:ood_airship} are submarine and ariship which are from unknown distribution and they doesn't adhere to the definition of ship by any means.
In general, one can argue that OOD can be defined as inputs which doesn't belong to any class in the training data.

\section{Problem Statement}
In this thesis, we study the application of out-of-distribution (OOD) detection over the 3D semantic segmentation problem in the context of autonomous driving.
Notably, we study the 3D semantic segmentation datasets available and create a benchmark for in-distribution and out-distribution for the OOD setting.

The other major issue, we address in this thesis is the OOD detection methods themselves.
Existing OOD detection methods are developed on 2D classification tasks and applicability of these methods on 3D semantic segmentation tasks is not studied. 
This is also challenging because the existing OOD methods are not easily adaptable to the 3D segmentation models because segmentation involves multi class classification and moreover high dimensionality of the 3D data.

\begin{itemize}
    \item[\textbf{R1}] How to create a benchmark over 3D segmentation datasets for the OOD setting?, i.e., create the in-distribution and out-distribution datasets.
